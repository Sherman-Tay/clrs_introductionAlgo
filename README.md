  <h3 align="center">Practicing Algorithms with CLRS Textbook</h3>


## About The Project

Focused on developing mastery over the basic and advanced data structures and algorithms by implementing them in code.
This was mainly done in Python.

### Facilitated With
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Referenced with CLRS Textbook](https://web.ist.utl.pt/~fabio.ferreira/material/asa/clrs.pdf)
